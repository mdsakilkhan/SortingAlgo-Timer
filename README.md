# SortingAlgo-Timer
10/21/2020

This simple program includes (only 2 at the moment, more will be added) sorting algorithms and puts them through a stress test to see how long it takes for them to execute. The program can be useful to prove which algorithms are faster at different array sizes. There a default constructor with several preset sizes but using the non-default constructor users can also input a number value for the program to run using that amount for the array size. This can also be used to see the computer processing speed. The algorithm records time in various units ranging from seconds to nanoseconds. A random number generator is used for the values of the array.
